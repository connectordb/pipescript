# Contributing to ConnectorDB

Pull requests and bug reports are welcome! Before posting your issue, make sure it doesn't exist yet.

ConnectorDB is split into several repositories:
to your problem:
- https://github.com/connectordb/connectordb-frontend - the web interface (the thing you see in your browser)
- https://github.com/connectordb/pipescript - datasets and transforms
- https://github.com/connectordb/connectordb - the connectordb server itself, and questions that do not fit elsewhere.

You may either post bug reports to the repository most relevant to your problem, or to https://github.com/connectordb/connectordb, which is considered the main bug tracker.

## Bug Reports

If you have an issue with the ConnectorDB server itself, please include a portion of the server's log file run in extremely verbose mode (`--vvv`).

If you have issues with the frontend, please copy the relevant lines of your browser's console.

When reporting a bug, please include enough information for someone unfamilar
with your setup to reproduce your bug.
