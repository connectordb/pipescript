The identity transform is a placeholder for the "current datapoint". It returns whatever is passed from the timeseries.

Suppose your timeseries has the following data:

```json
(44, 18, 20, -35, 20.23)
```

The \$ transform will simply return your data unchanged:

```json
(44, 18, 20, -35, 20.23)
```

### Usage

The identity transform is perhaps the most used transform in all of pipescript.
It is frequently used in comparisons and filters

For example, the transform `$ > 20` is a comparison - it checks whether the current datapoint, represented by the identity is greater than 20. The result of this transform would be:

```json
(true, false, false, false, true)
```

This is frequently used in filters: `filter $ > 20` would return

```json
(44, 20.23)
```

### Objects

The `$` transform accepts an optional argument. Sometimes, a datapoint isn't just your data - it can be an object:

```json
({ "hi": "hello", "foo": "bar" }, { "hi": "world", "foo": "baz" })
```

Running this transform:

```javascript
$("hi");
```

gives us:

```json
("hello", "world")
```

### Peeking

If given an integer index, the `$` transform performs a _peek_ operation - instead of returning the current datapoint, it returns the one at a relative index. For example, you can find the differences between the data of each successive datapoint with the following: `$[1] - $`, which would give

```
-26,2,-55,55.23
```

Currently, you can only peek forward in the timeseries (i.e. look at future datapoints).
