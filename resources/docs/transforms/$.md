The identity transform is a placeholder for the "current datapoint". It returns whatever is passed from the stream.

Suppose your stream has the following data:

```json
44,18,20,-35,20.23
```

The `$` transform will simply return your data unchanged:
```json
44,18,20,-35,20.23
```


### Usage

The identity transform is perhaps the most used transform in all of pipescript.
It is frequently used in comparisons and `if` filters.

For example, the transform `$ > 20` is a comparison - it checks whether the current datapoint, rpresented by the identity is greater than 20. The result of this transform would be:

```json
true,false,false,false,true
```

This is frequently used in filters: `if $ > 20` would return
```json
44,20.23
```

### Objects

The `$` transform accepts an optional argument. Sometimes, a datapoint isn't just your data - it can be an object:
```json
{"hi": "hello","foo":"bar"}, {"hi":"world","foo":"baz"}
```

By passing the object key to `$`, we can get the element:
```javascript
$("hi")
```

gives us:
```json
"hello","world"
```

The `$` transform is the main method for accessing sub-elements of a datapoint. It also works for array indices.
