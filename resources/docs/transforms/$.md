The identity transform is a placeholder for the "current datapoint".

Suppose the following is your datapoint:
```json
{
  "t": 435435435.43534,
  "d": 44
}
```

Then the transform:
```
$ > 20
```
will return:
```json
{
  "t": 435435435.43534,
  "d": true
}
```

When the datapoint is an object, you can query fields:


```json
{
  "t": 435435435.43534,
  "d": {
    "hello": "world",
    "foo": "bar"
  }
}
```

```
$("hello")
```

will give:
```json
{
  "t": 435435435.43534,
  "d": "world"
}
```
